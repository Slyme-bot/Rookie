<h1>Hello Bunchy Jr</h1>
<p><center>
	Ichthyology is also called fish science. It is the branch of zoology devoted to the study of fish. This includes bony fish (Osteichthyes), cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes) and jawless fish (Agnatha). The study of fish receives its origin from human's desire to feed, clothe, and equip themselves with useful implements. Hence, the study of fishes is known as ichthyology.
So, the correct answer is 'ichthyology'.
